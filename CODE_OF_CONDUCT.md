# Code of Conduct

This is the code of conduct for both ACM @ APU’s Space and GitHub.

## **Community Expectations**
First and foremost, we attend a God-First university, and **we expect everyone on both of these platforms to conduct themselves in a manner that is aligned with that God-First mission, whether in text chats, video conferences, Git README’s, code comments, or any form of communication on these platforms.**

Second, we believe that “God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:27), and as such, we expect everyone to be treated with kindness, respect, and decency, “for God shows no partiality” (Romans 2:11).  **Discrimination or harassment against another person based on their gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, intelligence, knowledge, or academic merit will not be tolerated, regardless of whether or not the other person is a member of ACM @ APU.**  Discrimination, harassment, and unacceptable conduct include, but are not limited to:
- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Vulgar language, swearing, or cuss words (any word not acceptable in a PG movie).
- Sharing sexually explicit or violent material.
- Sharing (or threatening to share) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

Third, we affirm that “with great knowledge comes great power.”  Computer Science and Technology are remarkable tools that allow us to impact the world in meaningful ways, but these tools can also be used in ways that harm others.  **Under no circumstance is any member of ACM @ APU allowed to engage in “hacking” of any kind, unless that hacking is ethical, and through a public club, organization, or event, such as “capture the flag” clubs and events.  Furthermore, under no circumstance is any member of ACM @ APU allowed to create, modify, copy, or distribute malware, viruses, spyware, phishing scams, or any other piece of code that harms an end user or accesses their information without the proper consent.**

Finally, this code of conduct is not exhaustive or complete, and as such, **we expect it to be honored in spirit as much as in the letter.**

## **Violations**
**A violation of *any* part of this code of conduct is grounds for removal from the club, subject to review by the club officers and/or APU faculty members involved with the club.**

## **Reporting Violations**
If you believe a member of the club has violated this code of conduct, whether that be directed towards you or another person, send an email to acmadmin@apu.edu with details of the incident, and one of our officers will be in contact with you shortly thereafter.
