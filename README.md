# Useful Software

This is a list of IDEs, extensions, student discounts, and any other software-related stuff that students who do anything CS-related might find useful.

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

First and foremost, GitHub has a student developer package that gives you a ton of benefits not only from GitHub, but also from some big names in the CS industry, like free AWS credits, MongoDB credits, free paid app subscriptions while you are a student, and more!  When I applied about a year ago, APU was not on the list of pre-approved univerisities, so it took a week for my verification to go through.  It's definitely worth getting, as it's valid for the duration that you are a student.  Details and form to submit [here](https://education.github.com/pack).

## JetBrains IDEs

JetBrains is an IDE development company that makes a good deal of IDEs all based off of the same "core" platform.  Their most famous IDE is IntelliJ IDEA, which is for Java development.  You can also use it for Python development and some other languages.  They also have a separate IDE called PyCharm that is specifically for Python development.  They make a ton more IDEs as well, including ones for C/C++, PHP, HTML/JavaScript, Ruby, Go, and others, but only IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm have "community" editions that are free to use.  However, if you are currently an undergraduate student, graduate student, or professor, you can get all of their paid IDEs, including the "professional" versions of PyCharm and IntelliJ IDEA, for free!  You can renew this annually while you are a student.  I personally have stopped using Eclipse, VS Code, and Arduino because IntelliJ and the rest of the JetBrains suite is leaps and bounds better than Ecplise and VS Code.  IntelliJ launches and compiles code so much faster than Eclipse does, and it has smart autocompletion, meaning it actually suggests the most likely piece of code for the line of code you're writing, taking into context what lines are around the line you're writing and other factors.  It also has an extensive collection of plugins, and the UI is so much cleaner.  I would highly recommend the JetBrains suite to anyone.  

You can verify your student eligibilty in a variety of ways, but if you already have the GitHub student developer pack, you can get instant verification and access to the full suite.  Link to verify eligiibiliity and download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).  Before you download, I would recommend downloading JetBrains Toolbox to manage all of your updates.  Updating each app individually can be a hassle since there are so many, so Toolbox manages all of your updates in one place.  Link to Toolbox [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).  If you just want to use the always-free community editions of IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm, you can download those from the Toolbox app directly once it is installed.
